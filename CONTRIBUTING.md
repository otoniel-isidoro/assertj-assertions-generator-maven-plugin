Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest !
We appreciate your effort and to make sure that your pull request is easy to review, we ask you to make note of the following guidelines :

* Use **[AssertJ code Eclipse formatting preferences](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/master/src/ide-support/assertj-eclipse-formatter.xml)** (for Idea users, it is possible to import it)
* Unit tests method naming convention is underscore based (like python) and not camel case, we find it is much readable for long test names !
